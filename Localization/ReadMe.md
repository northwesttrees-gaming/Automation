# Localization
You can help the mod out by adding support for your language based on the "en_ca.csv" copy.

## Opening The File
I have tested [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) An open-source word processing program with CSV files and they convert fine back to a usable format for MCreator to import.  
  
### Follow the steps below to open the file with Libre Office.
1. Download the CSV file
2. Open in with Libre Office spreadsheets (this should prompt you to a window like below)

4. Make sure the comma check box is selected and all other settings are the same in the window above.
5. Edit the line column B but leave the top two rows alone.

6. Don't edit column A or C either.
7. Once done you can go to File > Save As then you should have this window that pops up.

8. Make sure the settings are exactly the same name as the file through your language code e.g. FR_CA.csv, ES_ES.csv
9. Click save
10. You will then have this window pop up.

11. Select "Use Text CSV Format"
12. Then your file will be saved to the saved location you specified.

## Sharing The File
You can use the issue page and then use the forum to send the file directly to me via GitHub.
I will then add the translation in the next release.
